## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification model to distinguish between images of trucks and bikes. We utilize transfer learning with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) from the FastAI library to achieve this.

## Results
The trained model achieved good performance metrics. Key results include:

High accuracy in distinguishing between trucks and bikes (96% accuracy)
Detailed evaluation metrics and confusion matrix provided.

## Potential next steps
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
We could experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer types to optimize model performance.

- Advanced Data Augmentation:
We could apply more sophisticated data augmentation techniques such as Mixup or CutMix to further improve model generalization.

- Model Interpretability:
We could use techniques like Grad-CAM or SHAP to visualize what the model is focusing on when making predictions.

- Deploying the Model:
We could deploy the trained model as an API using frameworks like FastAPI or Flask to make it accessible for real-time predictions.

- Collecting More Data:
We could collect more labeled images to further train and improve the model, especially for classes where the model is currently underperforming.

- Transfer Learning with Different Architectures:
We could experiment with different pre-trained models and architectures to see if they offer better performance.
